Experian exposes nearly 30 different services.
This gem currently only implements the Precise Id product (identity validation).

*Net Connect is a business-to-business application gateway designed to allow access to Experian legacy systems via the public
Internet or Experianâ€™s private TCP/IP extranet transport. It is a secure 168-bit encrypted transaction, using HTTPS.
Net Connect is a non-browser-based system requiring Experian certified client or vendor software at the user's location.
It utilizes XML for the input inquiry and has the capability of returning field-level XML, as well as our standard Automated
Response Format (ARF) (computer readable), Teletype Response Format (TTY) (human readable) and Parallel Profile
(both ARF and TTY in one response). Net Connect meets the encryption standards requirement in the Safeguards section of the
Gramm- Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act.*

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'experian'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install experian

## Usage

### Configuration

Experian will provide you with the following authentication credentials when you sign up for their service:

```ruby
# Provide authentication credentials
Experian.configure do |config|
  config.preamble = "FCD2"
  config.op_initials = "AB"
  config.subcode = "1968543"
  config.user = "user"
  config.password = "password"
  config.vendor_number = "P55"
end

# Route requests to Experian test server instead of production
Experian.test_mode = true
```

### Using a product client

Products are namespaced under the Experian module. Example of how to create a client for the Connect Check product:

```ruby
client = ::Experian::PreciseId::Client.new
```

Once you have a client, you can make requests:

```ruby
response = client.check_id(first_name: "Homer", last_name: "Simpson")

response.success?
# => true
```

### Handling errors from Experian

```ruby
response = client.check_credit(first_name: "Homer", last_name: "Simpson", ssn: "NaN")

response.success?
# => false
response.error_message
# => "Invalid request format"
```

### Examine raw request and response XML
If you need to troubleshoot by viewing the raw XML, it is accesssible on the request and response objects of the client:

```ruby
# Inspect the request XML that was sent to Experian
request.xml
# => "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>..."

# Inspect the response XML that was received from Experian
response.xml
# => "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>..."
```
